# cookie-contest
This was something I was did for a Cookie contest as part of a remote christmas party. Did what I could in like 3-4 hours to get something up so that family members could upload an image of their cookie so everyone could see. I also needed to show the score for each cookie.

I had hosted a Strapi instance on my site, which actually worked just fine and was easy to use.

The end result worked, but I decided to not use it in the end because I wasn't confident in the UX for my whole family to use it effectively. 

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
